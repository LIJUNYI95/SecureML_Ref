## Homomorphic Encryption

Survey papers introducing HE:

- [A Survey on Homomorphic Encryption Schemes: Theory and Implementation](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3214303) - Introduing the development of HE and also several popular HE schemas.
- [Survey on Homomorphic Encryptionand Address of New Trend](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Survey-on-Homomorphic-Encryption-and-Address-of-New-Alharbi-Samkri/6468cffa6d7a1fba27d4e813a0a22531757d1d8a) - With some introduction of HE's application recently.
